# Line Chatter

In Japan, fictional Line chats that play with music running in the background has become popular. In fact many people post freelance jobs looking for people to write the scripts. The script writing is the easy part. Making the chats requires using a website called mojimaru that has it's own little issues with the user interface that makes the entering the chat and getting your final jpeg of the conversation a seriously labor intensive and time-consuming process. 

I wrote this app to help automate the entering of a the fictional line chat from a word document script to the mojimaru website.
