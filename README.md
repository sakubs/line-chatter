# Line Chatter

Application to automate the entering of a fictional line chat from a 
word document script to the mojimaru website. I made a web interface 
for it, but it can be run without any GUI, or you can make your own. 
I just needed a quick, and dirty way to automate this process.

## Getting Started

Since this is a special usage project, it is targeted at a private 
internal network server. Any usage outside of this is out of the scope 
and should not be done without serious hacking. 

Requires an internal network with one machine as a dedicated server to 
host the web interface. You can set that up however you see fit, I use 
an old, broken Thinkpad running LAMP on a Debian server.
    
### Prerequisites

A server of some sort to host the web interface, if you want to 

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
